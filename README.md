# ðŸ“¦  Github full release data

Github action to retrieve all release data from github releases.

## Why another github-action to fetch release data?

During the development of build jobs I had to use different Github actions to download release asset files, read the last tag name or retrieve the release notes.
The goal is to provide a simplified, well-documented Github action that provides all the information of a github release in just a single github action.
